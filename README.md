Download:
====================

To download the Tubby Tromp project, click the "Download ZIP" button on the right side of this page.

Unzipping the download should give you a folder called "TubbyTromp-master" This should contain the following:
(Folders are '+', files are '-')
  +Tubby Tromp GGJ Release
    -license.txt
    +press
    +release
    +src
  -Tubby Tromp GGJ 2014 Release.zip
  



====================
Contents:
====================

license.txt: The document provided by Global Game Jam that was mandatory to include in all submissions

press: Contains a few (admittedly crappy) screenshots of the game

release: Contains the Images and Sounds folders where all of the art and sound effects/music are stored.
TubbyTromp.jar is an executable that you can double click to run which will play the game.
The README briefly lists the requirements to run the game.
Note: If you move the .jar anywhere outside of this folder you must also move the Images and Sounds folders to the same location (as the .jar needs these in order to run).

src: This is where all of the code source files from the project are.
If you wish to import and run the game via this source code (as opposed to the .jar in the release folder), see the README in this folder for instructions.

Tubby Tromp GGJ 2014 Release.zip: This is just a duplicate of the .zip you're already in that for some reason git kept pulling out of thin air and putting in there
